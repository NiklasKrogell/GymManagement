# GymManagement

A customer/membership management system, where user can create customers and sign them to a membership, record their visits to a gym and attendance to classes. The user can also create these classes and define a trainer and schedule for a class.
All these are made with CRUD-possibility.
The graphical UI is made with .NET WPF.
The app uses Microsoft Access as a database.

## Purpose

I made this app during a school project-course.
I was the developer in our group, so every line of code in this project has been written by me.
We made this app to learn the basics of agile software development, and developing desktop-apps.
